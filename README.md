# README: Air Pollution Map App

## A. Getting Started
To create this project, I used:
* venv (python3 -m venv venv)
* Python 3.7.7
* Django 3.0.6
* npm
* React
* babel & Webpack
* pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
* material ui & react bootstrap

For you to use this project, you might have to run:
* python manage.py makemigrations (create migrations)
* python manage.py migrate (apply migration/changes to the db)
* npm install (make sure you have npm first)
* source venv/bin/activate (to get into the virtual environment; run this in the root folder - if this gives you error, first run 'python3 -m venv venv')
* npm run dev (to run webpack so the frontend will load)

To implement the tests, you should run:
* coverage run --source='.' manage.py test (run coverage)
* coverage html (generate report)


How to run this project:
1. install python (python3 -m venv venv)
2. set up virtual environment
